#Purpose:   This program will ask the user to input a string and field size 
            #which will be replaced by "." The final output will be the the
            #certain number of dots the user inputted, followed by the string
            #along with another set of the same number of dots. 

string = input("Please enter anything of your choice:")     #Asks the user to input a string.
fieldsize = int(input("Please enter a number:"))            #Asks the user to input a number.

dots = (fieldsize*".")                                      #The number inputted will be how many dots there are. 
print(dots+string+dots)                                     #The final output will be the dots, followed by the string and the dots once again right after.
