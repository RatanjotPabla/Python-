#Purpose:       This program is used to ask the user for their full name. It
                #will then print it back but in the sequence of their last
                name first, followed by their first name.





name = input("What is your full name?")     #This will ask the user for their full name
n = name.find(' ')                          #This will find the space in the person's name
print(name[n + 1:] + "," + name[:n])        #Once finding the space, it will ouput whatever is after the space followed by what comes before
