#Purpose:           This program will output the result to what each 'for' loop's condition is telling the program to do.

Question_A = print("1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n")
    #The 'for' loop which states that for count in range 5, it will print count + one. This will output "1,2,3,4,5, each in a newline.

Question_B = print("1\n2\n3\n4\n")
    #The 'for' loop which states that for count in range 1,5, it will print count,. This will output "1,2,3,4, each in a newline.

Question_C = print("1\n3\n5\n")
    #The 'for' loop which states that for count in range 1,6,2, it will print count,. This will output "1,3,5, each in a newline since the two in the condition
    #represents that the count must skip every other number from 1-5.

Question_D = print("6\n5\n4\n3\n2")
    #The 'for' loop which states that for count in range 6,1,-1, it will print count,. This will output "6,5,4,3,2, each in a newline since the -1 in the condition
    #represents that the sequence of numbers must go from 6-2 by subtracting by one each time.
